- Stochastic Approximation
  - SA refers to a broad class of stochastic iterative algorithms solving root finding or optimization problems.
  - SA is powerful in the sense that it does not require to know the expression of the objective function nor its derivative

- Stochastic Gradient Descent

> The famous stochastic gradient descent algorithm is a special form of the RM algorithm.

Mean estimation is a special case of the RM algorithm. SGD is a special RM algorithm.
